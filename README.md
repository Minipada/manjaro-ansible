# Manjaro-ansible
The goal of this repo is to install everything I need on a new machine thanks to Ansible.

More than the system packages, this contains customization for using:
* Plasma (application launcher, themes, splash etc.)
* Optimus Laptop (Using Nvidia + Intel graphic cards)
* Personal dotfiles
* Conky configuration
* Plank configuration (laptop + one monitor)
* Bluetooth configuration
* Using VSCodium (Why [here](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium#why-does-this-exist))
* X configuration (touchpad, optimus)
* Wifi, acpi drivers
* Grub configuration (nouveau and intel_pstate)

Because of this, I advise you to take a look before running it.


Still todo:

* [ ] Set up automatic backup
* [ ] ROS2 Installation
